Cerebro
=======
 
``Cerebro`` is a data system for optimized deep learning model selection. It uses a novel parallel execution strategy
called **Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP)** to execute end-to-end deep learning model selection workloads in a more 
resource-efficient manner. Detailed technical information about ``Cerebro`` can be found in our 
[Technical Report](https://adalabucsd.github.io/papers/TR_2020_Cerebro.pdf).


Install
-------

The best way to install the ``Cerebro`` is via pip.

    pip install -U cerebro-dl

Alternatively, you can git clone and run the provided Makefile script

    git clone https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/cerebro-system.git && cd cerebro-system && make

You MUST be running on **Python >= 3.6** with **Tensorflow >= 2.2** and **Apache Spark >= 2.4**


Documentation
-------------

Detailed documentation about the system can be found [here](https://adalabucsd.github.io/cerebro-system/).

We used the following projects when building Cerebro.
- [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod): Cerebro's Apache Spark implementation uses code from the Horovod's
 implementation for Apache Spark.
- [Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm): We use Petastorm to read Apache Parquet data from remote storage
 (e.g., HDFS)
