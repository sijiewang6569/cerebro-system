What is Cerebro?
---------------

``Cerebro`` is a data system for optimized deep learning model selection. It uses a novel parallel execution strategy
called **Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP)** to execute end-to-end deep learning model selection workloads in a more
resource-efficient manner. Detailed technical information about ``Cerebro`` can be found in our
[Technical Report](https://adalabucsd.github.io/papers/TR_2020_Cerebro.pdf).
